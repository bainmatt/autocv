Description: autocv is a collection of functions for generating 
  your resume from data stored in a spreadsheet. It includes tools for 
  retrieving job postings from the web, analyzing their key words,
  and assessing your resume based on its alignment with those key words.
  Spreadsheet templates are provided with conditional formatting to evaluate
  the quality of the content and skills included in your resume.
  Functions and spreadsheets for generating cover letters, as well as
  HTML, PDF, LaTeX, and plain text resumes, are included. The HTML version
  is optimized for long-form web-hosted CVs, while the LaTeX version is
  optimized for ATS compatibility.
